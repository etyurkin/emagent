;;; Commentary:

;; Claude-specific ACP adapter hooks.  Most Claude behavior is handled by
;; shared ACP normalization; add hooks here when claude-agent-acp diverges.

;;; Code:

(require 'emagent-acp-provider)
(require 'emagent-acp-gate)

(defun emagent-acp-claude--detect-p (state)
  "Return non-nil when STATE's agent is claude-agent-acp."
  (when-let ((launch (emagent-acp--agent-launch-string state)))
    (string-match-p "claude-agent-acp" launch)))

(defun emagent-acp-claude--enrich-tool-call (_state update)
  "Normalize Claude ACP tool-call UPDATE before display merging.
claude-agent-acp echoes rawInput fields as the title on tool_call_update:
title = rawInput.command for Bash, title = rawInput.description for Agent.
Strip the redundant title so the stored display name (e.g. \"Terminal\",
\"Task\") is kept and the rawInput field becomes the visible detail."
  (let* ((raw (or (map-elt update 'rawInput) (map-elt update 'arguments)))
