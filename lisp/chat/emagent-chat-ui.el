;;; Commentary:

;; Inline button dialogs used to ask the user for tool/eval/shell permission
;; inside a chat buffer.  This is UI, not a tool handler and not a policy
;; decision: `emagent-tools' stays FS/process, `emagent-policy' stays pure
;; match/decide, and both call into this module to ask the question.
;;
;; Names retain the `emagent-tools--' prefix: they are referenced widely by
;; tools, policy, and the ACP permission flow, and mocked directly by name in
;; tests.  Their home is here.
;;
;; No dependency on `emagent-chat' itself (that would cycle back through
;; `emagent-chat-tools-ui' -> `emagent-tools' -> here): the optional
;; `emagent-chat--writable' call below stays behind an `fboundp' check.
